# AFC-1.3 Adoptability Council MVP Implementation Log
Date: 2026-01-12

## Overview
Implemented mandatory research gate ("Council") that outputs structured decisions (ADOPT | ADAPT | BUILD) before BUILD runs can proceed.

## Components Implemented

### A. Database Models (Prisma)
- `CouncilDecision` model with all required fields:
  - Decision type (ADOPT | ADAPT | BUILD)
  - Confidence score (0-1)
  - Candidate solution (name, URL, license)
  - Maintenance risk (LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH)
  - Integration plan
  - Red team critique
  - Sources (JSON array)
  - Reasoning
  - Override tracking
- `DecisionType` enum
- `RiskLevel` enum
- Relations to Project and Task models

### B. API Routes (5 endpoints)
1. `POST /api/council/evaluate` - Create new Council evaluation
2. `GET /api/council/decisions` - List all decisions with filters
3. `GET /api/council/decisions/[id]` - Get specific decision details
4. `GET /api/projects/[id]/council` - Get project-specific decisions
5. `POST /api/council/decisions/[id]/override` - Override existing decision

### C. UI Pages (4 pages)
1. `/council` - Dashboard with stats, filters, and decision list
2. `/council/new` - Form for new Council evaluation
3. `/council/[id]` - Decision detail page with full reasoning
4. `/projects/[id]/council` - Project-specific Council history

### D. Tests
- Unit tests: `__tests__/models/council.test.ts` (18 tests)
- E2E tests: `tests/council.spec.ts` (30 tests)
